# Quickstart Guides

## Portkey integration methods

Currently, Portkey offers two types of integration methods for projects: Portkey SDK integration and Portkey wallet provider integration.

### 1. Portkey SDK integration

Integration with Portkey SDK can be completed within 1-2 hours, assisting Web2 projects to swiftly transition to Web3.

### 2. Portkey wallet provider integration

Portkey wallet provider supports developers in integrating with both Chrome browser extensions and mobile applications.  

For detailed guidance, refer to the [Provider Guides](docs/QuickStartGuides/PortkeyWalletProviderGuides/PortkeyWalletProviderGuides.mdx).

## Supported blockchains

- Layer 1 network - aelf
- Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains are gradually being supported. The documentation will be updated once the support is complete.

## Token and NFT collection launch

Currently, the creation and issuance of tokens/NFT collections in the aelf ecosystem require obtaining a SEED from the symbol market. Then the SEED can be used to create tokens/NFT collections.
