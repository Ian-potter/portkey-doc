title: How to add/remove login accounts?
---

* A login account is a special guardian that's linked to your Portkey account. While it also takes the responsibility of safeguarding your account and assets as all guardians do, a login account is distinct in that it represents your identity. To log in to Portkey, you must provide the correct login account.
  You can have multiple login accounts for a Portkey account, and you have the flexibility to add or remove them as needed.
  Add a login account:
  1. On the Portkey home screen, click "My" (App users) / the avatar in the top right-hand corner (extension users).
  2. Select "Guardians" and choose the guardian that you want to set as a login account.
  3. Click the toggle switch to set it as a login account.
  4. You will then be presented with a list of your existing guardians. To activate the setting, you'll need to obtain approvals from your guardians. Simply select a guardian and click "Send" to send a verification code.
  * Depending on the number of guardians you have, the requirements for approval differ as stipulated here.
  1. Repeat the above process until enough codes have been obtained and verified. Then you can click "Confirm" to set this guardian as a login account.
     Remove a login account:
  2. Go to "Guardians" and select a login account you want to remove.
  3. Click the toggle switch to remove this login account.
  4. You will then be presented with a list of your existing guardians. To activate the setting, you'll need to obtain approvals from your guardians. Simply select a guardian and click "Send" to send a verification code.
